# OpenMotion-Electronics
This repository contains the electrical layout files for all of the PCBs required for OpenMotion

# Overview
Electrical files for OpenMotion will be uploaded when major releases occur.

OpenMotion is still in development and files here represent prototypes for the three PCBAs required for OpenMotion. Those are: the console board, the camera aggregator board, and the camera sensor board. Eight camera sensor boards connect to a single camera aggregator board. Each aggregator connects to the console board via a 10 pin cable. Two aggregator boards (more broadly, sensor modules), may be connected to the console at a time. The console contains power conditioning electronics, laser control electronics, and components for connecting the two aggregator boards to the host PC. A power supply provides 12V to the Console Board. The console board connects to the host via USB Type-C.
